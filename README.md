## Vision
The **JobPlacement** smart contract aims to streamline the job placement process by leveraging blockchain technology. It provides a transparent and automated platform where employers can post job listings, and graduates can apply for these jobs directly on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized approach ensures a fair and efficient job matching system.

## Flowchart

3. **Apply for Job**:
   - Graduates apply for job positions. The job is marked as filled once a graduate applies.

4. **Check Status**:
   - Employers and graduates can check job details and placement status.

## Contract Address

Please ensure to replace the placeholder with the actual address once deployed on the Ethereum network.

## Future Scope
